              <p>We sketched, we designed, we tested and had a lot of fun. Finally the Avakai can come to life and we are really excited about that. The hearts of the first dolls will start beating for the first time in March 2016. There will only be a limited amount of 500 pre-orders available, so be quick to pre-oder your Avakai now.</p>
              <p>Be one of the first families to give your kids a creative and screen-less way to spend quality time. In the meantime we are convincing our ambitious woodcrafters to hurry up and carve more Avakai to make the world a little happier.</p>
              <p>Adopting an Avakai is really easy, just klick below.Â </p>
