  <p>We should stop talking about play and simply do it.<br />Therefore, we invite you to an exciting real life adventure with Avakai twins and Vai Kai play wizards. We bring games, crafts and of course our Avakai twins. You only need to bring your kids, your camera and loads of energy!</p>
  <p>Playdates are organized all over the world.<br/>Let us know where you want us to go next and we will make it happen.</p>
