  <p>As soon as you hold an Avakai in your hands you will immediately recognize how much love we put into making them. We work together with local manufacturers throughout Europe that have known their craft for generations. ItÂ´s a combination of talented handcraft and super precise technology.</p>
  <p>Of course we think of our planet when producing. Thats why we only use wood that comes from sustainably managed forests within the EU to also give future generations woods to play in, fresh air and innovative toys.</p>
