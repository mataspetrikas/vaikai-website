title: Traditional Craftsmanship with the Standards of the 21st Century

  As soon as you hold an Avakai in your hands you will immediately recognize how much love we put into making them. We work together with local manufacturers throughout Europe that have known their craft for generations. ItÂ´s a combination of talented handcraft and super precise milling machines. And of course we want to take care of the planet and only use wood that comes from sustainably managed forest within the EU to also give future generations fresh air and innovative toys.
