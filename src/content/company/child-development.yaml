title: Child development, open-ended play & embracing technology
theme: gray

  <p>The world is full of screens, blinking and beeping, there is no way around it. Not even for your kids as they grow up in the connected world of today. We love technology and think kids should embrace it in the early stage of their development so we want to give children a good head start with it, but in a way they explore the future, using all their senses. Kids need to have the opportunity to express themselves and evolve their imagination.</p>
  <p>Experts, educators, development specialists and researchers are our close companions when it comes to designing play experiences that matter. But the real experts for us are kids.</p>
