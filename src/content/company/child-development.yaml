  Play with the future – the world is full of screens, blinking and beeping, there is no way around it. Not even for your kids as they grow up in a connected world. We still want to give them the possibility to express and evolve their imagination. It´s time to offer them a fulfilling way to explore the future, using all their senses. Kids, experts, educators, development specialists and researchers are our closest companions when it comes to designing play experiences that matter.
