title: Design Thinking for Intuitive, Connected Toys
theme: gray

  Once upon a time, back in 2014 we had a great idea. What if kids could play with mobile technology so naturally like it was their favorite wooden toy? So we started the design process with the kids in mind, not with the possibilities of what we can produce.</p>
  <p>When the first kids held our very first prototype in their hands, we held our breath.. with oxygen back in our brains we realized that it really worked! So we started Vai Kai: focusing on designing play that is intuitive and sensory, that helps to express emotions and brings people closer together.
