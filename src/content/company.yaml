  title: Design Thinking for Intuitive, Connected Toys
  text: |
    Once upon a time, back in 2014 we had a great idea. What if kids could play with mobile technology so naturally like it was their favorite wooden toy? So we started the design process with the kids in mind, not with the possibilities of what we can produce. When the first kids held our very first prototype in their hands, we held our breath.. with oxygen back in our brains we realized that it really worked! So we started Vai Kai: focusing on designing play that is intuitive and sensory, that helps to express emotions and brings people closer together.

    Play with the future – the world is full of screens, blinking and beeping, there is no way around it. Not even for your kids as they grow up in a connected world. We still want to give them the possibility to express and evolve their imagination. It´s time to offer them a fulfilling way to explore the future, using all their senses. Kids, experts, educators, development specialists and researchers are our closest companions when it comes to designing play experiences that matter.

    As soon as you hold an Avakai in your hands you will immediately recognize how much love we put into making them. We work together with local manufacturers throughout Europe that have known their craft for generations. It´s a combination of talented handcraft and super precise milling machines. And of course we want to take care of the planet and only use wood that comes from sustainably managed forest within the EU to also give future generations fresh air and innovative toys.
